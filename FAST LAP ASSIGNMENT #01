/*The cost to become a member of a fitness center is as follows:

(a) the senior citizens discount is 30%

(b) if the membership is bought and paid for 12 or more months, the discount is 15%

(c) if more than five personal training sessions are bought and paid for, the discount on each session is 20%

Write a menu-driven program that determines the cost of a new membership. Your program must contain a function that displays the general 
information about the fitness center and its charges, a function to get all of the necessary information to determine the membership cost,
and a function to determine the membership cost. Use appropriate parameters to pass information in and out of a function. Do not use any
global variables.*/
